This repository contains code, examples, and software from the paper:  
[*Efficient Inference in First Passage Time Models*](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2503.18381).

It implements a fast and flexible numerical method for computing the first passage time density in first passage time models. It is especially suitable for efficient likelihood-based inference in generalized drift diffusion models, commonly used in computational cognitive neuroscience.

More detailed instructions will be available upon publication.
